## What Is It?
A standalone and simple police armory script that allows police officers to go to a police station to edit their loadouts. Uses a clean and efficient user interface with no bloated dependencies.
## Why?
This script adds to the immersion of vMenu or non-economy based servers.
## For Owners
- Configure the weapons offered at the armory
- Configure the locations of the armories
- Easily readable code
## How to Configure
- Weapons are found in `police-armory/resources/armory.js`
- Locations are found in `police-armory/config.lua`
## Technical Information
- Built with pure Lua and Javascript (of course making use of the FiveM APis)
- No required dependencies
- Makes use of a thread, but with minimal overhead
